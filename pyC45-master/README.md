pyC45
=====

pyC45 is a super light C4.5 decision tree package for python which 
contains only one file “pyC45.py”. It provides the user a simple and 
efficient interface to train a C4.5 decision tree and use it to do predictions
or classifications. The trained decision tree is saved as an XML file so that
it can be read and easily understood. C4.5 is one of the most popular algorithms 
in Data Mining and Machine Learning as the so called “Big Data Era” is coming. 
It is developed by 张驰昱 in Tsinghua University, in winter, 2013.
